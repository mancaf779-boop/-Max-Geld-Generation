# SEO Audit Report: [Client or Domain]

**Client:** [Client Name]  
**Website:** `[domain.com]`  
**Prepared by:** Claude  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Report type:** [Real audit / Mock audit]

> **Data note:** [Briefly state which datasets were available, which important datasets were missing, and what additional exports would be needed for a fuller analysis. Keep this as a note, not a standalone scope section. Run the bundled chart generator when chartable data exists and keep `chart_manifest.md` with the report outputs.]

## 1. Executive Summary

**Headline: [Succinctly summarize the main audit finding in one sentence.]** [One condensed 150–200 word paragraph. Distill all main findings without omitting any: organic traffic trend, largest traffic-capturing pages or page types, branded versus non-branded keyword mix, keyword dependency, key technical SEO issue, and backlink quality/link-building reading. Use only report-backed numbers.]

## 2. Organic Traffic Trend

[Insight-first finding. State whether traffic is growing, stagnant, or declining over the last six months. Explain which landing page, folder, country, page type, and organic keywords caused the movement where data exists. Mention a Google core update only as a coinciding factor unless evidence proves causation.]

| Period | Organic Clicks/Visits | Change | Main Landing Page / Page Type Driver | Keyword Driver | Insight |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| [Month/Period] | [#] | [%] | [Page/page type/country] | [Keyword or intent] | [Evidence-backed reading] |

### Top Organic Countries

[Explain why the highest-traffic country leads by naming its leading pages, leading keywords or intents, and traffic share where data exists. The finding should answer whether this market wins because of core keyword rankings, localized utility demand, brand demand, or a page cluster that fits local search behavior.]

## 3. Page Type Analysis

**[Largest page type] captures [X]% of global organic traffic.** [Explain what the page type is: landing page, utility, tool, blog, docs, comparison, localized page, or homepage. Then state the strategic reading, such as whether utility pages win because they target high-volume keywords, brand pages dominate navigation demand, or localized templates match market demand.]

## 4. Branded vs Non-Branded Search Terms

**[Branded/non-branded] search dominates organic search, with [dominant type] capturing [X]% of traffic and [other type] capturing [Y]%.** [Mention only the top traffic-driving keywords and explain what they reveal about demand quality, brand dependency, discovery, and fragility.]

| Non-branded | [#] | [%] | [Keywords] | [Reading] |

## 5. Keyword Portfolio

[State whether the keyword portfolio is branded-heavy or non-branded-heavy, and whether traffic is fragile because it depends on a few terms or resilient because it is spread across many. Refer to the top 10 keywords and keyword coverage.]

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [Cluster] | [#] | [#] | [#] | [%] |

### Multilingual and Locale Page Analysis

**Locale pages capture [X]% of organic traffic, led by [locale(s)].** [Explain which locales work, what content types or intents perform best there, and what share of organic search clicks these locale pages receive.]

![Traffic share by locale](assets/locale_traffic_share.png)

| Locale | Pages | Clicks / Traffic | Traffic Share % | Leading Page Type | Insight |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| [Locale] | [#] | [#] | [%] | [Type] | [Reading] |

## 7. Site Architecture

**Verdict: [State whether the architecture is helping or hurting organic growth in business terms, e.g., high-intent pages are too deep, orphaned, under-linked, or indexation logic is diluting crawl focus.]** [One concise paragraph that connects architecture evidence to ranking, traffic, crawling, indexation, or conversion impact. Do not describe structure unless the consequence is clear.]

![Indexable pages by homepage click depth](assets/site_architecture_click_depth.png)

**Click depth:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation from crawl/internal-link data; state the impact on important pages; name the fix.]

**Orphan pages:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation from crawl, sitemap, GA/GSC, or orphan-page export; state the impact on discovery/indexation; name the fix.]

**Hierarchy and URLs:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation on folder logic, URL patterns, parameter duplication, locale/folder consistency, or commercial-page grouping; state the ranking or crawl consequence; name the fix.]

**Internal link equity:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation on inlinks to priority pages, homepage/template link flow, or authority routing; state the impact on commercial or non-branded pages; name the fix.]

**Crawl budget:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation on redirects, broken links, duplicate URLs, parameter URLs, paginated URLs, or non-indexable crawled pages; state how crawl focus is diluted; name the fix.]

**Indexation logic:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation on indexable/non-indexable decisions, canonicals, sitemap inclusion, noindex, duplicate/thin pages, or blocked pages; state the traffic or quality consequence; name the fix.]

**Navigation and breadcrumbs:** [3–4 lines maximum. Observation on global navigation, footer links, hub pages, breadcrumbs, or missing path reinforcement; state how users and crawlers are affected; name the fix.]

> **Appendix note:** Keep raw URL lists, full orphan-page inventories, long broken-link tables, and crawl-detail exports outside the report body unless the user asks for them.

### Domain Quality

### Distribution of Backlinks
