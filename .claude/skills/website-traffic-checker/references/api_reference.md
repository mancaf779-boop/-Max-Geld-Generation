# API & Tool References

This document provides instructions on how to gather the necessary data for the Website Traffic Checker skill.

## 1. Similarweb Data Gathering

Use the built-in `search` tool with `type=api` to query Similarweb.

**Key Data Points to Extract:**
- Total Visits (last month)
- Bounce Rate
- Pages per Visit
- Average Visit Duration
- Top Countries (Traffic share by geography)
- Marketing Channels (Direct, Organic Search, Paid Search, Social, Referrals, Mail, Display)

*Note: Similarweb is best for overall traffic volume and channel distribution.*

## 2. Ahrefs Data Gathering (via MCP)

If an Ahrefs MCP server is configured in Claude Code, call its tools directly to fetch SEO data.

**Key Endpoints/Tools to Call:**
- **Site Explorer Overview**: For Domain Rating (DR), total organic keywords, and total organic traffic.
- **Top Pages**: To identify the pages driving the most organic traffic. Note the URL, top keyword, and estimated traffic.
- **Organic Keywords**: To see which keywords rank in the top 10 and their respective search volumes and traffic share.

*Example (generic MCP tool invocation, exact syntax depends on the connected server):*
```
ahrefs.site_explorer_overview(target="example.com")
```
*(List the available tools/servers configured for the current session to see exact tool names.)*

## 3. Semrush Data Gathering (via API)

If Semrush is used, query the Semrush API endpoints.

**Key Endpoints / MCP reports:**
- **Global snapshot**: `domain_ranks` (no `database` param) returns one row per regional database. **Sum `Organic Traffic` and `Organic Keywords` across all desktop databases (exclude `mobile-*` and `-ext` to avoid double counting) to get the global Traffic Overview figures.**
- **12-month trend (global)**: `domain_rank_history` is per-database. **Pull it for the largest regional databases and sum month-by-month** to build the global trend; disclose coverage (e.g., "top 12 markets ≈ X of total global desktop traffic"). Do NOT report a single-country trend as the headline trend.
- **Keywords**: `domain_organic` with `display_limit=500`, `display_sort=tr_desc`.
- **Page types / concentration / underperformers**: `domain_organic_unique` with `display_limit=1000`, `display_sort=tr_desc`.
- **Geography (locale breakdown)**: make a SEPARATE `domain_organic_unique` pull with `display_limit=2000`, `display_sort=tr_desc`, then infer locale from URL path (`/en/`, `/es/`, `/zh_CN/`, etc.).
- **Competitors**: `domain_organic_organic`.

*Note: Ensure you have the user's Semrush API key or a configured MCP connector/environment variable holding it. The Semrush Traffic Analytics (Trends) module requires a plan that includes MCP/Trends access; if unavailable, mark total visits, bounce rate, channels, device split, and referral pathways as "Requires Similarweb".*

## 4. DataForSEO Data Gathering (via MCP)

If a DataForSEO MCP server is configured in Claude Code, call its tools directly to fetch SEO and traffic data. If no such server is configured, tell the user it needs to be added (e.g., via their MCP configuration) before this data source can be used, or propose an available alternative.

**Setup check & tool discovery:**
List the MCP servers/tools available in the current Claude Code session to confirm a DataForSEO-capable server is present before proceeding.

**Most useful modules/tools for traffic analysis:**
- **DATAFORSEO_LABS** — primary module for this skill:
  - *Domain Rank Overview* (`dataforseo_labs/google/domain_rank_overview`): organic & paid `etv` (estimated traffic volume), total ranked keyword `count`, and position buckets (`pos_1`, `pos_2_3`, `pos_4_10`, `pos_11_20`, `pos_21_30`, ...). Use `pos_11_20` to source near-winner keywords and `is_new`/`is_up`/`is_down`/`is_lost` for inflection signals.
  - *Ranked Keywords* (`dataforseo_labs/google/ranked_keywords`): the full keyword list a domain ranks for, with position, monthly search volume, and SERP elements. Use for branded vs non-branded split, intent, and top non-branded keywords.
  - *Competitors Domain* and *Domain Intersection*: for competitor and keyword-gap context.
  - *Top Pages / Relevant Pages*: pages driving the most organic traffic, for page-type efficiency and concentration analysis.
- **DOMAIN_ANALYTICS**: technologies and Whois details (supporting context only).
- **BACKLINKS**: referring domains and anchor text, if backlink context is needed.

*Example (generic MCP tool invocation; global/worldwide scope for the 12-month trend):*
```
dataforseo.domain_rank_overview(target="example.com", location_name="World", language_name="English")
```

*Data volume constraints (MANDATORY):*
- **12-Month Organic Traffic Trend MUST be global/worldwide.** Use a worldwide scope (e.g., `location_name: "World"`), never a single country, when pulling the trend.
- **Cap keyword pulls at 500 keywords** (set `limit`/`display_limit` ≤ 500) for ranked/organic keyword requests.
- **Cap page/URL pulls at 1,000 URLs** (set `limit` ≤ 1000) for top/relevant pages requests.

*Notes:*
- DataForSEO is credit-billed per request; query only the modules needed and save raw JSON output to files for reuse rather than re-querying.
- DataForSEO Labs estimates traffic from search volume × CTR (the `etv` metric), so treat it as estimated organic traffic, comparable to Ahrefs/Semrush estimates rather than Similarweb total visits.

## 5. User-Uploaded Data

When the user attaches their own data files instead of (or alongside) an API/MCP source:
- Accept common formats: **CSV** and **XLSX** exports from Google Search Console, GA4, Ahrefs, Semrush, or any analytics/SEO platform.
- Load with pandas (`pd.read_csv` / `pd.read_excel`), inspect the columns, and **normalize** them to the metrics the report needs (URL/page, keyword, position, search volume, clicks/traffic, impressions, date/month, channel, country, device).
- Map source-specific column names to the standard fields rather than assuming a fixed schema. Only ask the user for clarification if a critical field is missing or ambiguous (e.g., no date column for the MoM trend).
- Cite uploaded files by filename in the report's References section, with the collection/export date if known.
- First-party uploads (GSC/GA4) are authoritative for the owning domain; prefer them over third-party estimates when both are available, and note the source distinction in the report.
